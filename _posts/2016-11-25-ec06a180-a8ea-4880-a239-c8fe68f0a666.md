  “ The beer tastes good to my throat, cold and bitter and the three boys and
  the beer and the queer freeness of the situation makes me feel like laughing
  forever. So I laugh and my lipstick leaves a red stain like a bloody crescent
  moon on top of a beer can. I am looking very healthy and flushed, and bright
  eyed having both a good tan and a rather excellent fever!”
